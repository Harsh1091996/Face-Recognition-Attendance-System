# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
These project is part of the “Industrial Practice II” curriculum as final year project at [Presidency University](https://presidencyuniversity.in/). 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective<br>
Taking and tracking student’s attendance manually is a time consuming process. In order to make the
attendance system accurate I am developing a system that record student’s attendance automatically
without faculty member’s manual interference through Face Recognition Technique.



### Methods Used
* Histogram of oriented gradients(HOG)
* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning


### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy
* Face Recognition
* OpenCV
* Dlib
* Flask
* OpenPyxl


## Project Description
* Encode a picture using the HOG algorithm to create a simplified version of the image. Using this simplified image, find the part of the image that most looks like a generic HOG encoding of a face.
* Figure out the pose of the face by finding the main landmarks in the face. Once we find those landmarks, use them to warp the image so that the eyes and mouth are centered.
* Pass the centered face image through a neural network that knows how to measure features of the face. Save those 128 measurements.
* Looking at all the faces we’ve measured in the past, see which person has the closest measurements to our face’s measurements. That’s our match!
